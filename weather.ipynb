    "**Create a single folder:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`mkdir` = it's the shortcut to make a directory, Example: `mkdir data` - it will create a folder called **data**.\n",

    "``` bash \n",
    "mkdir data/timestamps\n",

    "Learn more about **date** formatting:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "man date\n",
